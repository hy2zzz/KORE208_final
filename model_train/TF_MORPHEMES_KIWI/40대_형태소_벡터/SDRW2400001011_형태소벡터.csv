SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2332865783850418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28607588834458997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32600945974209183,0.32600945974209183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32600945974209183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32600945974209183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19942303337226894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2393566047697709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32600945974209183,0.3026498179546823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2627162465571804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2732201497825437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22204889508009146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2467574090632347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3201259388728964,0.3448344528560397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3448344528560397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3448344528560397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3448344528560397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3201259388728964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22625323053530844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23564697157949907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3201259388728964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39113411056768016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5313549057364044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5313549057364044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5313549057364044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21377848153317708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45852140531135943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33664706194849375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45852140531135943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45852140531135943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45852140531135943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36936109575638965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36936109575638965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2875894861766459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3428951677618458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36936109575638965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3428951677618458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36936109575638965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36936109575638965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3998914627738095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44388306208764355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5296464311839117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4916955357828277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.347512306570147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5254837362743862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6520825080712402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5464935915256758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42747579713059874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42747579713059874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3751134047051658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3582564794679017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42747579713059874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42747579713059874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43953229921727555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3318538627314949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3422257231262542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43953229921727555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43953229921727555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43953229921727555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4355546954547678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5197089272747789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5197089272747789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5197089272747789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4651837788515038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35122113702864255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3328772489434602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34153858599058284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4651837788515038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4651837788515038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41183544364393915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33494198339359277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44362243926777867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35749521570684617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44362243926777867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44362243926777867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31171521809548475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47508778736347357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47508778736347357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47508778736347357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47508778736347357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3568382952071068,0.44280725444377145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38856688017778795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4110786694730903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30259792094112337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3568382952071068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37110537982436237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36862018149985154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36862018149985154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42007617949278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38997635022973376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2569645249808307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3520550500954602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30842052297375916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3385203522368053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4490594915779903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5767425926244554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3648034220362522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5767425926244554,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39430396764337755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39430396764337755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2977057544709019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39430396764337755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39430396764337755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3660508014720942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39430396764337755,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28265933866948245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44511699780512215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5080909838608757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5628195573873234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3834739293218125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40268182924238377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2022349402288793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3103926073923879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40268182924238377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43376231476512545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43376231476512545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40268182924238377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41439200150801586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6435368167735941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6435368167735941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3541745609041306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4949459932674452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4949459932674452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3736920813368576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4949459932674452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4937170122552729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4937170122552729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4937170122552729,0.0,0.0,0.31228776561941185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4137715394678752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5575055398023308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25992829639947856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5575055398023308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5575055398023308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.453012880738401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3796584529377906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4205530293356129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3527218840851762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3796584529377906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.453012880738401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26819699148038373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3328106177017266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2920439584325365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2591307954157106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26819699148038373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3328106177017266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3328106177017266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20358336525904086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22743033221119363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3328106177017266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23815336620989375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3328106177017266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35138204095915143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26998212061843796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41927313716554265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28058494874369183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3892308485061318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2652002421216348,0.3892308485061318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41927313716554265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3864774791638743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4611494221234418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4611494221234418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4611494221234418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4611494221234418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42256377094454933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9063331945179556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2378503149496079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29515286432554566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13761043742949508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29515286432554566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22980996528917882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29515286432554566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29515286432554566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.258998980968769,0.0,0.0,0.29515286432554566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29515286432554566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18054776557367017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27400419830638456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29515286432554566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29515286432554566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37058706479281167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21440647704273944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45986835745316834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45986835745316834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45986835745316834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42691728876955165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43005809364765696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5336670594419113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49542807290401936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5336670594419113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33471090409892773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.510135705938095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34139177594497905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47358281767801663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32267298030175906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42753162468381706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2592850659737951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1877344222243364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4026609717043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4026609717043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32448622566016444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2463114796160289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4026609717043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4026609717043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2881370387607929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7551704987035216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6555284264529453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43796332563803786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5090175025498996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5090175025498996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5385076504487154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6274707744504361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7786401140517807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2464502560910172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2615426501982496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.335847686279173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38272894438282823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38272894438282823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2420851700718625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2341188722209815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38272894438282823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2810001303246368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3553051664055601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5398015984275293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4075587752386277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5011230521500265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5398015984275293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33402875268110177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32482016554031584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4424128875950239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4424128875950239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4424128875950239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4424128875950239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41687630999922354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4091297339772019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2962289167505278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4091297339772019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6353646925929454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49542807290401936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5336670594419113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5336670594419113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43005809364765696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26551717208860337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2392027527220949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14771155295388208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31681817718695976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31681817718695976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2941171207922091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2941171207922091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2941171207922091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31681817718695976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2466788674698779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25530940855977663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2780104649545273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2941171207922091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3959228902075438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3959228902075438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42648169560576465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42648169560576465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2697598269703536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26088283905238224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42648169560576465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5497653798858141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42805467315201057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4607442359387021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5497653798858141
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23294536129672433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32172711139748045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35752732930828623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49963136446901973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49963136446901973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4638311465582139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39186896703239776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2804144719192811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39186896703239776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39186896703239776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39186896703239776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39186896703239776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39186896703239776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7827757838957518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.504052006607552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3649570478580893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.3419609701538679,0.3419609701538679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3419609701538679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15943398955053079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3419609701538679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30007346533237705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3174583505845191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3419609701538679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3419609701538679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2865887007056093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5150248242948441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5150248242948441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45193837088722044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5150248242948441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3950374434136325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36673172130956594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18418007059968883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26995381821604947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3950374434136325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36673172130956594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3950374434136325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3950374434136325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4932381173377538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37897632026155076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5885374570121157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.516446289540195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.555923439245219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39780893808468004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.516089710456286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.516089710456286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2454472668242193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3811713358438982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2967850969689356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3811713358438982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3538591656020105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3811713358438982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3811713358438982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3811713358438982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3309587153001996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3565033433726062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3565033433726062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3565033433726062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3565033433726062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3565033433726062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2775782683090293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22549685300314892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3565033433726062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2912831215014995,0.3791053181436469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4523528738701416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4523528738701416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39694323698460743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4523528738701416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4693211684835337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4693211684835337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4693211684835337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4118330501791665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4118330501791665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.424147649088882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23596028624374663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36215467221124603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.424147649088882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5060979069091315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4441049300314956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3542466345216752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5399102770924278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5399102770924278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5399102770924278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6438161222601126,0.0,0.0,0.32333744795147185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6935082519121029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4170795081716228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34896591800409055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47529998391456374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3700749205160241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4412431888307976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3830227130878566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6164099087697734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5409045871712566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5722421270297499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5722421270297497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5409045871712564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6164099087697733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3643678218854041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.448016644719677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4825962403929044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4825962403929044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.448016644719677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5038478361427569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36992579134094145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3186957529424623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5038478361427569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5038478361427569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31171521809548475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47508778736347357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47508778736347357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47508778736347357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47508778736347357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4400398475873322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41705705735593335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5828219818365359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5410608846821768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3349146799834059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31742245995452073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44358627657087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44358627657087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44358627657087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44358627657087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5292524942165704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5292524942165704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39959403411039207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5292524942165704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37676818021493363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2613376423435645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3159991085992183,0.0,0.4058485536517777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29797458003108795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4058485536517777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3270549534679319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4058485536517777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28597987816385506,0.37877333216681014,0.37877333216681014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37877333216681014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37877333216681014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2395831511623775,0.0,0.0,0.37877333216681014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37877333216681014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39022488559375795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35155114857709785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46562087105066313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4085860098138805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46562087105066313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35155114857709785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4241435433165592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38210825428936085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4441006310716073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4698297921056627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5060930078538538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5911235494899117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5911235494899117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5487676179193667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5110054032477818,0.0,0.5350495737570765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2842806779230323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.60973758915911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4461757771636362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.319275460580608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4461757771636362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41420582654623106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35955283498182855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4461757771636362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33253329168289825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3197491045801949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3967825903546425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3967825903546425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3967825903546425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3967825903546425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3967825903546425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2999274096463352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2513614539047125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27843663187225864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2513614539047125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2796729900137739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23352749009433207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2999274096463352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2999274096463352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2999274096463352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18346839956876487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2999274096463352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2999274096463352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2999274096463352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2656961529752842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5698766899939011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5698766899939011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5290431652496085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33737130098242646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43092979243986307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5141904392187234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5141904392187234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41436276822764145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3313229282380854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31858527335674985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25456983097672786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3670110860977043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39533837061810745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39533837061810745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39533837061810745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.346912557877153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4489183821703211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4835675773033324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4835675773033324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3113831734255059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4835675773033324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41572363936548123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22088083763450742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4737548482530818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4737548482530818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.368871857237124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43980876718231915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47415990655148743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3173161390101972,0.0,0.0,0.47415990655148743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47415990655148743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47415990655148743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42586288495509467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42586288495509467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39564813579410185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4717343311168551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5081445462895701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5084091112237116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4805672414367186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5476500227164106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4589714094596017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3307214044678643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6224564672692301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7093456836983737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4161707856845331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3055531773360885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3353731723867422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4161707856845331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28439555413960516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3240361364307963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4161707856845331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2978044216660628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5444209432322601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5054114058233453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5444209432322601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38957795626018443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8407683193886274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5413950804287225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2690585458696043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3563614427047029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23848333764356566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3308269822782727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3563614427047029,0.0,0.0,0.3563614427047029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23381633413475225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3308269822782727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3563614427047029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.298657366659018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3838128638170206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5960484462024168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5960484462024168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37701483409535275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5911235494899117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5911235494899117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5487676179193667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4401631995781349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4401631995781349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3547075712381127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4401631995781349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4401631995781349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3149729668636899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5559534893003892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5008550067779773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.663370168096331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5864191120525274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5283012949723715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6140116991963921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4826738950081983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31669262492821826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4826738950081983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4480887351283438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4826738950081983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.631253651736432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.315626825868216,0.315626825868216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23830326356578163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29301113368366594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2457512654090497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.315626825868216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.315626825868216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2781718434964722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17177559423258593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6175464153263028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3233018126574801,0.3684317818184879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3684317818184879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3684317818184879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36606485239468245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43679283850309863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43679283850309863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3206939175769995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43679283850309863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43679283850309863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까?

음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19716860595773872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4228958201903665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4228958201903665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4228958201903665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4228958201903665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4228958201903665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2586893255475917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3412291242739374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3412291242739374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3412291242739374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24417749997244384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3412291242739374,0.3412291242739374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24417749997244384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28597535948204317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3412291242739374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3167789438504106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5878821114682659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5556880833986159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5878821114682659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.5247303417938259,0.0,0.0,0.4871317002421797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5247303417938259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4604550395218107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400647,40대,어 나는 뭐 지금 딱 직장을 말한다면 쪼끔 망설일 수는 있겠지만 현재 다니고 있는 직장에서는. 근데 이 업으로 인제 만족감을 느낀다고 한다면 나는 상당히 만족을 느끼고 있어. 왜냐하면 내가 어렸을 때부터 어 꿈꿔 왔던 그런 업 중의 하나였기 때문에 게임을 제작하고 만드는 거가 어렸을 때부터 너무 좋아했었고. 어 그거를 인제 업으로 삼으면 굉장히 좋겠다라고 생각을 하면서 20대 초반부터 지금까지 그 업을 계속하고 있고 나름대로 성과도 얻었고. 어 그리고 20년이 이렇게 흘렀나라고 허무할 정도로 시간이 빨리 흘러간 것 같고. 어 한번도 물론 굉장히 고비가 많이 있었지만 이 일을 선택하는 거에 대해서 후회한 적보다는 잘했다고 생각했던 게 훨씬 더 많았던 거 같아. 너도 너는 현재 직장 생활에 만족하고 있어? 어 지금 다니고 있는 직장 생활은 만족하고 있지 않아. 어 왜냐하면은 음 너무 이제 힘들고 그 힘든 만큼 어떤 보상을 충분히 제공했었으면 좋겠는데. 그런 부분들이 좀 물론 이제 요즘 어 경제가 안 좋다 보니까 그런 회사들이 좀 많이 없어졌지. 그래서 나의 기대감보다는 어 많이 못 미치는 어떤 보상과 처우나 어 여러 가지 이제 이유가 있지. 그런 부분들 일의 강도라든지. 이런 부분들이 개선되고 있지 않아서 지금은 어 아쉽지만 되게 좀 어렵다고 생각을 하고 있어 이 회사를 계속 다닐 수 있는 점에 대해서는. 그래서 음 뭐 당연하겠지만 이제 이직을 좀 준비해야 되는 시점이 온 거 같고. 음 그거를 뭐 꼭 반드시 막 불만족스럽고 뭐 부정적인 시선보다는 그런 접근보다는 어 좀 더 도약한다는 생각으로 좀 긍정적으로 알아보는 게 필요하지 않을까? 계속 좀 그런 부분은 되게 스트레스받고 이러고 있는 것 내 자신이 그러고 있어서 그런 의미보다는 계속 여기에 안주해 있다기보다는 뭐 나이를 핑계로 계속 있다기보다는 도전을 해야 되는 시점이 이제 온 거 같아. 그래서 어 뭐 꼭 만족 불만족보다는 그런 쪽으로 생각을 하고 있는 중이야. 너는 그러면 재택근무에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 어 좋은 질문이야. 근데 음 내가 지금 다니고 있는 회사에서는 이제 여자분들이 적지 않거든. 왜냐하면 어 게임의 어떤 장르가 어 여성의 시선이 굉장히 좀 필요로 하기 때문에. 그래서 근데 뭐 그런 건 없었던 거 같아. 그 여자라서 뭐 좀 배려해 줘야 되고 음 쪼끔 업무를 더 이렇게 다르게 봐야 되고 그런 거는 아 오히려 안 하려고 굉장히 노력을 했는데. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 이제 자녀가 있는 또 여성분들은 뭐 이런 말 하면 좀 그렇지만 좀 힘들지. 근데 아이러니하게도 그런 사람들이 많이 없어 또. 이쪽 업계에서는 결혼 자체를 좀 많이 안 하셔 보면은. 그래서 그런 건지 그런 분들은 우리 회사 통틀어서 한 한 200명 중에 1명 정도 계시는데. 역시나 좀 힘들어하시고 또 서로가 눈치를 좀 볼 수밖에 없고. 그런 것들은 음 좀 풀기는 쉽지 않을 것 같다 내가 내 생각에는. 근데 그거를 차별을 안 하려고 나 역시도 많이 노력은 하지만. 근데 또 정말 필요할 때에는 뭐 이런 재택근무나 코로나로 인해서 막 이제 꼭 유선상이 아니더라도 통화나 이런 거를 할 때가 많아졌거든 메신저나. 근데 못하게 되더라고 근무 시간 외에는. 할 수밖에 없는 비상사태가 분명히 발생되는데. 어 그런 거는 할 수 없는 부분들이 좀 많이 아쉬워서 음 쪼끔은 꺼리는 건 사실인 거 같아. 그러면 어 그런 의미에서 뭐 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들이 있을까? 음 우리 회사는 없 부족하지. 그 우리 회사뿐만 아니라 모든 회사들이 아직 그 복지에 대해서 물론 이제 잘하는 곳도 있지만 부족한 곳이 여전히 많은 거 같아. 그러니까 시대가 많이 바뀌었잖아. 특히 나는 이 코로나 전과 후가 굉장히 큰 그 어떤 전환점이 됐다고 생각하거든. 근데 물론 되게 안 좋은 일로써 그렇게 되긴 했지만. 그 이후부터 이제 재택근무가 굉장히 좀 구체적이 구체적으로 도입이 됐고. 그리고 거기에 따른 어떤 다양한 기술들이 뭐 줌으로 미팅을 한다거나 그리고 그 거기에 맞춰서 뭐 아까 얘기했던 뭐 컴퓨터가 자동으로 꺼진다라든지. 그런 것들이 생긴 것도 진짜 좋은 나는 긍정적인 변화라고 생각하고. 그게 꼭 사람이 사람끼리 만나서 얘기하는 것도 꽤 중요하지만. 그런 거를 없이도 업무가 가능을 할 수 있는 그런 환경을 만들어 주는 것도 되게 중요한 거 같고. 그런 시대가 변함에 따라 복지도 거기에 맞춰 줘야 될 거 같아. 그래서 주 4일 근무도 계속 얘기가 나오고 있거든 여기저기서. 근데 그것도 결국에는 어 같은 맥락에서 그런 재택근무나 유연 근무나 이런 것들이 음 어 껄끄럽지 않게 되는 상황이 된다면 주 4일 근무 역시도 너무 자연스럽게 이루어질 수 있지 않을까 생각하고. 그런 환경에 맞춰서 복지 제도가 좀 추가돼야 되지 않을까라는 생각을 하고 있어. 어 나도 관리자 입장이기도 하고 근데 걱정되지. 그 사람을 인제 다룬 그러니까 지시를 해야 되는 사람들 입장에서 보면. 근데 음 이제 시간제는 유지하고 근무제를 4일로 한다면 난 나쁘지 않다고 생각을 하고 삶의 질도 굉장히 좋아질 거 같고. 그리고 거기에 맞춰서 책임 의식도 좀 강해질 거 같아 직원들이. 이렇게 어 그러니까 꼭 그 9시부터 6시 9시 출근 6시 퇴근이 아니라 근무 시간 그런 그러니까 실제 근무 시간을 잘 카운팅해서 거기에서 계산을 해서 주 4일 근무를 한다면은 그 모두가 만족할 수 있는 그런 복지가 아닐까라는 생각도 해. 음 그렇지. 그런데 어 나는 충분히 가능할 거 같다는 생각이 많이 들어 최근에 들어서는. 우리가 잘 생각해 보면 한 시 20년 15년 전만 해도 그렇지 않았거든.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.680362668083079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7328755964547284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4612831925723887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4004185093237923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4968867498910888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4968867498910888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36481495200509234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29859011048606976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3277305556763188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.681667713235322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.582035873059844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23824882413968776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36999239688254615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5587002652838549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3246712647622368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3434812341019361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3434812341019361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2528389698613174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29816010198162674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3069196615244796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3763710515575301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2931003734842847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.428908999954011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3763710515575301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3594576099209605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3069196615244796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3594576099209605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5223522049445996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5223522049445996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5223522049445996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4259630523514277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6008395796345511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5272414997789453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6008395796345511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5336670594419113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5336670594419113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49542807290401936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43005809364765696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.284573994661137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4026440506691035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34951659447621186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43372162030065115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26531156865177263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43372162030065115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43372162030065115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35954200141869846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44616233359435037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44616233359435037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44616233359435037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44616233359435037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2729216692430466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5191006736317516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4819054161774628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2420226242142156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45551496102892053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4819054161774628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3589425853543245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40904767964519717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27952788980819365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40904767964519717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3589425853543245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3003233828438081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26838489656755543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40904767964519717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7036322814225162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16402880971073402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3518161407112581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3266073660071578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3518161407112581,0.3518161407112581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2280062469004517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20540939581196543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2720597050729947,0.0,0.0,0.21182932282320333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2720597050729947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5441194101459894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2720597050729947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2720597050729947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23873455044248004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2720597050729947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2720597050729947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25256573928340964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2881366414457622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45374236493193815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6180080277953628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5737257356113756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4170928821144061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4170928821144061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33611624810366053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2850256803622148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3660023143729603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3872068158451063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4170928821144061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3648753180401827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2940364800846842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3648753180401827,0.3648753180401827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3648753180401827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33873081065923527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3648753180401827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3648753180401827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5593302223302293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2607790262794269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40024677154457666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5593302223302293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38222536035293353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40328448240866904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3743878330447516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6280053769139674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40328448240866904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3743878330447516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18067723526827453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2643943826210315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2643943826210315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2643943826210315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17693736545432787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2454496622024381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4908993244048762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2643943826210315,0.2454496622024381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19962195568686786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2643943826210315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2643943826210315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21306344873535632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2643943826210315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33880314149415625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33880314149415625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33880314149415625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29730244562091934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33880314149415625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33880314149415625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3145267906544794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2730260947812425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2222959586656089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33880314149415625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.680362668083079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7328755964547284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29744700265374224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21136342189119248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39781074681881207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3033840823287277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45334148012426023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45334148012426023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45334148012426023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6119573958025007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4931487270502117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39405709739439543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4764782080268534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.235940359441037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3353146025260046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2897842827469944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24573629752872092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35959868755027774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35959868755027774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.235940359441037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24573629752872092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35959868755027774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2897842827469944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3155507023320042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7328755964547284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.680362668083079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.372313021997744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40104952970632457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.351924145304498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.372313021997744,0.372313021997744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.372313021997744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40104952970632457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24721832823135095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3564124892542406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3093851238231906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3839217345391153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3839217345391153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.563751757076632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3217549389472756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2480165912114029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2959362805863986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25968643495536314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5918725611727972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21727683425319036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2959362805863986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2747314802353122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18102698862215486,0.2747314802353122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25968643495536314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21727683425319036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18538758768825067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39762737869811027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3332412870825391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39762737869811027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3691360792781405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2717236831507138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3691360792781405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28453508901882574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3332412870825391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33520358759670593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28046121991640866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27334879029942194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33520358759670593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3819949354290965,0.24162089193192474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3819949354290965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3546237515889479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3819949354290965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.508812299605473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5913608534105878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6256215987509476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31507798514347884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40459256732212007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46106998059714216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31507798514347884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46106998059714216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46106998059714216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2584779871551297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2584779871551297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3520532430208897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32682747916247357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32682747916247357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3520532430208897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29504677522453704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3520532430208897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32682747916247357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29504677522453704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5269895210418216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41678010367977714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47574506023472035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5676645378663776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5197089272747789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5197089272747789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5197089272747789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4355546954547678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35355472845040303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16483939923301424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25958037987343885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22363178385853782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2849137300632767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29630513157490945,0.0,0.21627273167615044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35355472845040303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35355472845040303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2752824373182947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2849137300632767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3282213782605651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2515773304481769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3121869722850082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24307294943077437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3121869722850082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3121869722850082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2739465458968419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28981775683634314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2515773304481769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28981775683634314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3121869722850082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3121869722850082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28981775683634314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2707283874417363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2916242141600888,0.5832484283201776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23500673572458916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19928508400744208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21411090900623664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19928508400744208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1844592590086475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2916242141600888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17838925728908953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2916242141600888,0.2916242141600888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3157350938807832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3157350938807832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21576155769283437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2458355643307859,0.0,0.3157350938807832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3157350938807832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2458355643307859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3157350938807832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25443660081630637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3157350938807832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3157350938807832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2646094678048852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4295596874285408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34616268142274165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4295596874285408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4295596874285408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37694203498070455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4295596874285408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37645247856891145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.584618015895948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4711171599971192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5427282270395167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2153931628279428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1330087476623968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2153931628279428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4307863256558856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28528295953585636,0.28528295953585636,0.28528295953585636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5705659190717127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2298966060533224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28528295953585636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4491033989570824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4491033989570824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4491033989570824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3496779093146229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36191207268469044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3763820167303597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3918938979039272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3918938979039272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3918938979039272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3158095289241989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3918938979039272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3918938979039272,0.3638134210952187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6487137704048853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5050972125919362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5692514821403052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6163898546815362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6163898546815362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39691128608820514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2873821933717475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3763593472851479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4296056811810822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5126104942678948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4296056811810822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47588027934702104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4222493228621595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4421172824802089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5038328019815462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.344300498358064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5038328019815462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4623435206302133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37601973846366177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34033434107059696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32676738263682864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41738523687627127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49802891802327814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3358209110398883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3826984315656028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3552768399312735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3358209110398883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3207297201640018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3826984315656028,0.3552768399312735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3552768399312735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35548947190964236,0.0,0.33001749103652883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3119448329939665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35548947190964236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.286472852120853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35548947190964236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35548947190964236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3119448329939665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33001749103652883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.564206982328627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8256333817691872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46376872981989625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46376872981989625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37373019809076186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46376872981989625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46376872981989625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34461378723101915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46937227699617445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46937227699617445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46937227699617445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46937227699617445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7328755964547284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.680362668083079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39258181780320683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4522553030027348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4871620541317976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4871620541317976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4082779975266964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34553372617226635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3322497395274257,0.0,0.0,0.26548860574244304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41229485995724907,0.28174689142003967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3322497395274257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41229485995724907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41229485995724907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5911235494899117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5911235494899117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5487676179193667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22414149455436888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2968699102688742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22414149455436888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2605057024116215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2968699102688742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2968699102688742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2968699102688742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2968699102688742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19478267235409014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2968699102688742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27559821230395176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.181598098624524,0.0,0.0,0.2968699102688742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2605057024116215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5150248242948441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5150248242948441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45193837088722044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5150248242948441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7786401140517807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6274707744504361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41577959444847434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44787101434248894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32882752989014125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30605830511983717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34871835818117947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41577959444847434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3609189497841558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3784923357650957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3784923357650957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40770578595813856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3784923357650957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40770578595813856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2675044515330835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40770578595813856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2720524027252271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2720524027252271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5441048054504543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2720524027252271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2720524027252271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21923470002182302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2720524027252271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2720524027252271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25255896017269225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2720524027252271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2720524027252271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38401262919647106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4214897544610912,0.0,0.3574221856538301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5230344485329725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5230344485329725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28765259218936556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3186368382038936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3186368382038936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4691016680546252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25200025647621194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2345508340273126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34323041784328484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34323041784328484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25200025647621194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2765938361156031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4329768593563935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4329768593563935,0.0,0.0,0.3628667783423079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4329768593563935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40195265427717786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3799406304682712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36657685474579116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49928650385303114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4381278697900888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49928650385303114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41843918724029244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3349486300186711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4828924936565973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5201639374323742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4191765396769358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4564479834527127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3523705674780845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.704741134956169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3795678421645236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3523705674780845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3330737939940689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44878369363254084,0.0,0.44878369363254084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32949762031108587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41662687728868314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41662687728868314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3761140799142727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4651107754710297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3112603015254725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38979738759789884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4081383968943053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38979738759789884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4651107754710297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27083929162092907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4047103737176251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32613774584934374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3551365649792285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3757115545877403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31511290648914175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3551365649792285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4047103737176251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3938317287592658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3938317287592658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3938317287592658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7312248000905497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31636698458257884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2549458128911384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31636698458257884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2322770859190487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2322770859190487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31636698458257884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31636698458257884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29369825761048907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31636698458257884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27761453986322815,0.0,0.0,0.29369825761048907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27761453986322815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5409045871712566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6164099087697734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5722421270297499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31499738782689723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22807272907817372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48918033049968873,0.0,0.48918033049968873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39420825524556474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3342875472093105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32096163586093346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.301989560217453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2063683739384835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5607020452494325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5061793786023933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.301989560217453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22172116068886316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25308968930119663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.301989560217453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3385360547799134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21799317407543223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22655427490650146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3385360547799134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3385360547799134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3385360547799134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3142788415750028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.283718367150857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2728108617044886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2728108617044886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3385360547799134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4564198177753151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5204053357941923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4650617973791509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5518847352820657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38613337787645846,0.0,0.38613337787645846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26386911275462505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2533503350331764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38613337787645846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6472169207783528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6552888431135941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4477998938639039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6083352588386799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6026374582447044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5231215803622751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6026374582447044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33584455770233995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34254805741724603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47518682537899104,0.0,0.4289796586766153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5118635169361347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31311169712914405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2842653147043436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19717489704811328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14276377714022168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2311903693247794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22481685613182917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30620597195949845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30620597195949845,0.30620597195949845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2009082613156505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26869817064213897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2842653147043436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30620597195949845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30620597195949845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30620597195949845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48415599348909016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6412527347022737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5953048834046697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3613322993872106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5507095985485114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25675979437318025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5507095985485114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44379190342554503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35161085343306614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1765860656331224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3787494905558932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3323556839625306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3787494905558932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3052170468397036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3787494905558932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3323556839625306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31742021419135663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3364982536249217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7217361215701789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6048684949046477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27245841797142045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19360673676896328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.415256167900484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.415256167900484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3048816636701193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2540160788425328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32332400279900697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3643905830728975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38550170819909485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2725412926212564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3251994394834489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23876188675435842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2327069422765961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3251994394834489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3251994394834489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3251994394834489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3251994394834489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3251994394834489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2725412926212564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3251994394834489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38424202564416376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38424202564416376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35670983045627846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35670983045627846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24304222999601754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38424202564416376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3096432319068964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38424202564416376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.453523943012759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.453523943012759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.453523943012759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.453523943012759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42102747233005944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5574624193487846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3730636439456773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.489177697359122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5574624193487846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.380015357613118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17717625648175384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.380015357613118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3334664923519811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3527860169842312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31848110483929476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3062371517230943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3527860169842312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3527860169842312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400648,40대,너는 한 업종에서 20년 넘게 지금 근무를 하고 있잖아 일을 하고 있잖아. 근데 직장 생활에 대해서 너의 업에 대해서 만족하고 있어? 아니 현재 뭐 나는 뭐 사실은 다양한 업을 하고 있잖아. 다양한 업을 하고 있으니까 아이들이 내 생활의 중심이니까. 이 직장 생활 자체로는 만족이라기보다는 정말로 경제 수단으로써 그냥 활용하고 있는 거 같아. 그냥 이 업에서 느낄 수 있는 성취감이라든지 보람이라든지 그런 거에 집중할 수 좀 없는 거 같기는 해. 물론 내가 인제 5년 동안 다녔던 직장도 그렇고 그 간혹 간혹 중간 중간에 그런 요소들이 있었는데. 그러니까 아 이거 너무 보람되다 뭔가 뭔가 프로젝트 하나를 제대로 해 냈 해 냈거나 그거를 마무리 지었을 때 물론 보람되고 그런 게 있는데 . 그 보람되기 위해서는 사실은 아이들이 조금은 방치돼야 됐던 부분이 있어서. 그게 좀 모든 워킹맘들이 다 그럴 거 같은데 죄책감이 동반된다 그럴까? 나는 약간 그런 감정이 있어. 그 되게 되게 여기서 막 기쁨을 느끼고 막 했을 때 그 옆에서 막 아이들 징징거리거나 뭐가 잘 안 됐거나 아이들의 스케줄을 엄마가 돌봐 줘야 되는 어떤 스케줄을 내가 놓쳤을 때 그때 갑자기 인제 좀 이게 왜 다시 현타 온다 그러지 요즘 말로. 뭐가 중요하지 그런 생각에 혼자 다시 빠져들게 되는 거 같아. 그래서 그게 되게 고민이 돼. 음 그런 부분이 있어 여자에게 인제 사실은 주부에게 직장 생활이란 쪼금 그런 거 같아. 지금도 마찬가지고. 지금도 그렇게 막 만족스럽진 않아 아이들이 다 크지 않아서. 그래서 너는 그러면은 지금 지금 다니는 회사 자체에는 만족감이 있으니까 네가 물론 지금 업에 대해서는 만족감이 있는 거는 알고 있는데. 회사 자체로는 벗어나 이직을 하고 싶다거나 그런 생각이 있어? 나는 이제 이전 직장을 그 재택근무로 5년 동안 근무를 했었잖아. 그러니까 재택근무에 대해서는 그 내가 직장인으로 장 생각했을 때는 장단점이 있어. 물론 장점은 아이들의 스케줄을 어느 정도 소화를 하면서 근무를 할 수 있고. 경제 활동을 할 수 있기 때문에 뭐 수입적인 부분에서는 뭐 만족스러울 수 있고. 이제 그런 제도가 있기 때문에 일을 할 수 있는 거니까 좋은 점인 장점이기도 한데. 단점은 사실 그 그냥 나라는 인간 하나를 놓고 봤을 때는 너무 정신이 없어. 사실은 일 일하는 공간하고 그냥 이제 집에서 집이라는 내가 쉴 수 있는 공간하고 같은 공간이기 때문에 일을 하면서도 이렇게 주위에 너저분한 것들이라든지 내가 해야 될 일들이 너무 고스란히 다 보이니까. 좀 집중력이 살직히 솔직히 좀 떨어지는 부분이 있거든. 그래서 좋은 부분이긴 한데. 그리고 회사도 그런 재테크 하는 친구들에 대해서 아 그러니까 재테크래 재택근무하는 친구들에 대해서 쪼끔 이렇게 경계를 강화한다고 해야 되나? 사실 컴퓨터 앞에서 20분간 멀어지면은 컴퓨터가 뭐 꺼진다든지 뭐 이런 시스템이 있거든. 그래서 그런 걸로 강화시키고 조금 의심하는 부분도 있기 때문에 서로 좋지 않은 부분도 있어. 그리고 인제 내가 관리직에 있기 있었잖아. 그 5년 동안 근무했던 회사에서는 관리하는 부분도 있었기 때 있었는데. 좀 이게 가정주부가 와 가지고 다시 재취업을 하거나 하려고 했을 때 면접을 볼 때 사실은 인사팀에서 제외시키는 경우가 사실 진짜로 많아. 왜냐면은 애들 때문에 일 열심히 하겠어요? 집중할 수 있겠어요? 하면서 사실 채용하는 게 쉽지 않더라고. 그래서 내가 묻고 싶은 거는 너는 그냥 남자잖아. 남자로서 그 여자들이랑 일했을 때 그리고 인제 아이가 있는 여자 워킹맘들이랑 일했을 때 성과를 제대로 내고 있다고 생각해 일에 대해서? 어떻게 바라보는지 남자 직원들은. 그게 궁금해. 음 그 겨. 음 복지 제도가 추가되었으면 하는 것들은 많지 사실은. 맞는데 나도 인제 관리직에 있다 보니까 사실상 아이 엄마들은 안 뽑는 게 회사가 이익이긴 하더라고 이게 좀 슬픈 일인데 슬픈 현실인데 그렇긴 해. 사실 복지 제도라 하면은 사실은 뭐 내가 지금 내가 근무했던 것처럼 재택근무 하는 것도 복지 제도라고 할 수 있어. 어쨌든 근무 그리 그거나 탄력 근무제. 뭐 정해진 시간 내에 근무를 하면. 근데 탄력 근무도 이게 불편한 게 일찍 출근해 가지고 일찍 퇴근을 해도 나머지 직원들이 7시 8시까지 근무를 하면 그 서로 핑퐁이 돼야 되는 부분들이 있잖아. 서로 이렇게 업무를 조율하고 물어봐야 되는 부분이 있으니까. 연락이 그들이 근무할 때까지 연락이 와. 그렇기 때문에 그게 의미가 있나 싶기도 한 거야 탄력 근무를 일찍 퇴근을 해도 연락이 올 수밖에 없어서. 그래서 인제 그런 부분이 사실은 복지라면 복지고. 사실은 육아 제도도 지금 현재 있잖아 육아 휴직이라는 것이 있잖아. 근데 육아 휴직을 줘야 되는 사람은 애초에 안 뽑으려고 하는 경향이 있고. 그래서 인제 그 복지 제도가 사실은 회사 내에서 사 인제 회사 내규로써 정해지는 게 사실은 먼저긴 하지만 국가적인 차원에서 쪼끔 손을 봐야 되는 부분도 있는 거 같아. 그래서 그 국가적인 차원에서 복지 제 그 육아나 인제 출산이나 육아에 대해서 복지를 쪼금 확대했을 때 그런 회사들한테 조금 어떤 인센티브나 그런 부분을 줘야 될 것 같아 국가에서. 그런 게 있어야 워킹맘들도 제대로 일을 하면서 경제가 돌아가지 않을까? 그런 생각이 드네. 그럼 너희 회사는 좀 그런 복지 제도가 쪼금 있는 거 같아? 주 4일 근무를 하면 과연 업무 효율이 날까 나는 의문이 들긴 하거든. 어쨌든 우리가 주 5일제로 줄어든 지 쪼끔 이제 길긴 하지. 주 5일 근무가 된 지는 오래되긴 했는데 주 4일까지 된다면은 일은 어떻게 되는 걸까? 난 이게 관리자의 입장에서 봤을 때는 좀 그런 생각이 들기도 하더라고. 그러면은 금요일에 일해야 되는 8시간을 나머지 4일에 쪼개진다는 말이지?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34982344213774036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34982344213774036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32475745079000173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34982344213774036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32475745079000173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2341079928113898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34982344213774036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34982344213774036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34982344213774036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
