SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401391,20대,우리가 이번 여름에도 국내 여행을 다녀왔잖아. 물론 해외여행을 계획했었지만 또 어쩌다 보니 또 다른 국내 여행을 다녀왔었는데 나는 국내 여행을 많이 다녀 봤다고 생각했음에도 같이 다녀왔던 곳들을 1번 더 갔을 때 되게 국내 여행의 매력이 있다라는 생각이 들었어. 특히 우리는 어쨌든 지금 도시에서 살고 있고 나는 우리의 휴가는 보통 자연 혹은 시골과 가까운 곳에서 시간을 보냈었는데 국내 여행에 대해서 만족도가 높았어? 그럼 만약 시간이나 비용적 부분이 국내 여행과 해외여행에 별 차이가 없다면 요즘 많이들 가는 뭐 몽골이나 일본 동남아 등이 있잖아. 내가 생각하기에는 이동 시간이 길긴 하지만 비용적인 부분에서는 환율을 따지면 큰 차이가 나지 않을 거 같은데 그런 경우에서도 국내 여행 많이 메리트가 있다고 생각을 해? 혹시 다녀왔던 곳 중에 인상 깊었던 여행지나 혹은 그러한 이유가 있는 휴양지가 있어? 어 나랑은 좀 반대인 거 같아. 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 내가 살던 곳에서 벗어나서 새로운 환경이랑 새로운 분위기를 느끼고 싶어서 가는 경우가 많았거든. 그래서 음식 같은 경우는 내가 크게 취향이 까다롭지 않기도 하고 음식을 크게 중요시 여기지 않기 때문에 여행을 가면 항상 여행을 갈 스폿이나 혹은 자연경관을 좇았지 음식 같은 경우는 오히려 편의점에서 라면으로 때운 경우도 많고 혹은 프랜차이즈 햄버거로 때운 경우도 많은 거 같아. 그래서 나는 여행을 다니는 이유가 먹거리에 대해서는 크게 중요시 여기지 않았었는데 그런 얘기를 들어보니까 먹거리에 대한 궁금함도 생기는데 혹시 방금 얘기했던 부분에서 이러한 나라에서는 이러한 분위기 이런 환경에서는 이러한 음식을 먹는다라고 했는데 그런 음식의 예가 있을까? 그렇구나. 혹시 우리가 이번 여행지는 국내 여행으로 다녀왔는데 내년 여행지는 혹시 해외여행으로 갈 계획이 있어? 그러할 의향이 있을까? 아무래도 장거리는 조금 힘들 수 있으니 내가 생각하는 여행지는 몽골이거든. 몽골 아니면 혹은 중국. 동남아는 습하고 더울 거 같아서 막연히 좀 피하고 싶고. 좀 건조하고 날씨가 습하지 않은 곳으로 가보고 싶긴 해. 사실 나도 가까운 일본은 1번도 가본 적이 없어서 요즘 일본도 다들 많이 다녀오잖아. 그래서 나는 내년 휴가는 가까운 해외로 갔으면 하는데 혹시 어떤 것 같아? 음 친한 친구들이 각자 다녀온 경험을 나한테 공유해 준 적이 있는데 특히 게르에서 자는 게 굉장히 매력적인 거 같더라고 아무래도 요즘 몽골이 많이 대세이고 여행을 많이 가는 이유가 그런 자연경관이나 한국에서는 볼 수 없는 생활양식 혹은 저렴한 비용. 그리고 멀지 않은 비행시간인 거 같은데 나는 그중에서 게르도 그렇고 자연경관이 굉장히 마음에 들었거든. 넓게 펼쳐진 초원. 그리고 거기에 있는 양이나 말들에서 나는 그런 곳에 가면 지금 일상에서 벗어나서 조끔 더 리프레시될 수 있지 않을까 하는 생각이 들었어. 혹시 내가 얘기한 몽골 말고 다른 여행지를 생각해 보거나 어 이런 여행지 괜찮다라고 생각했던 곳이 있어? 내가 여러 번 캐나다를 같이 가고 싶다고 했잖아. 근데 방금 얘기를 들어보니까 우리가 갔던 여행지도 그렇고 내가 가고 싶어 하는 캐나다도 그렇고 하고 싶어 하는 액티비티를 즐기기에는 음 쪼금 그런 시간이 부족했거나 혹은 캐나다는 마땅한 수상 레저 스포츠를 즐길 곳이 없는 것 같아. 그래서 내가 방금 캐나다를 얘기했지만 우리 휴양지는 몽골보다도 적당한 수상 레저 스포츠와 자연경관이 괜찮은 일본 정도로 타협을 하면 어떨까 싶네. 나는 한국 오기 전까지 겨울이 긴 나라에서 살았어서 겨울 휴가도 따뜻한 곳으로 떠나기보다는 오히려 눈이 더 많이 오고 겨울을 즐길 수 있는 곳으로 다녀왔던 거 같아. 음 겨울 휴가라고 해서 긴 시간은 아니고 크리스마스부터 새해까지 그 기간이 보통 겨울 휴가로 내가 여행을 다녀왔었는데 시간도 그렇지만 아무래도 기간이 기간이다 보니 항공권이 비싸서 장거리나 먼 곳은 다녀오지 못했고. 보통 캐나다 안에서 쪼금 더 위쪽인 곳으로 가서 퀘백에 스키장을 간다거나 아니면 시골에 있는 카티즈를 가서 친구들과 그냥 낚시를 한다거나 혹은 스케이트를 탄다거나 하는 식으로 쉬는 곳에 조금 더 집중했던 것 같아. 그럼 우리 이번 겨울도 휴가 기간이 생기잖아. 혹시 시간이 많이 타이트할까? 음 그럼 휴가 대신에 우리가 여러 번 얘기했었던 스키장 가기는 이번 겨울에 꼭 이뤄졌으면 좋겠거든. 개인적으로 오랫동안 안 가기도 했고 나는 보드를 못 타는데 이번 기회에 보드를 조금 배워볼 수 있는 기회가 됐으면 하는데 인스타그램을 보니까 보드를 탄 사진 같은 게 있었던 거 같은데 스키장을 자주 다녔었어? 아 그렇구나. 나는 한국에서 스키장을 아주 어릴 때 외에는 가보지 않았었는데 요즘은 스키장에 가서 뭐 스파 시설이나 부대시설이 잘 돼 있어서 다들 쉬러 가는 느낌으로 잘 다녀오더라고. 그래서 나는 이번 겨울에 성수기 기간이 아니더라도 이번에는 시즌을 놓치지 않고 스키장을 한번 다녀오면 어떨까 하는 생각도 들고. 스키장을 얘기하니까 썰매도 타고 싶다는 생각이 드네. 가까운 곳에 있지 않을까 자수정 동굴 나라 같은? 맞아. 주말 이용해서 양산 같은 경우는 꽤 가까운 거리라 주말 이용해서 다녀와도 좋을 것 같고. 나는 또 반대로 겨울이니까 따뜻한 스파나 온천도 좋을 거 같다는 생각이 드는데 내가 수안보 온천에 대해서 여러 번 얘기를 했었잖아. 거기에 대해서도 얘기를 하고 찾아보진 않았지만 지금 자기가 살고 있는 곳과 가까웠던 것 같은데 오히려 겨울에는 그런 스파도 괜찮을 거 같다는 생각이

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거

SD2401392,20대,응. 나는 각각의 장단점이 있다라고 생각을 하지만 특히 국내 여행의 장점은 비용과 어 시간을 아낄 수 있다는 점을 예로 들고 싶어. 여행이라는 것은 어 예쁜 것을 보는 것도 좋지만 누구와 함께 가는지가 가장 중요하다라고 생각을 해. 그래서 나는 해외여행에 대한 로망이 딱히 없는 편이고. 국내 여행에서 어 좋아하는 사람과 맛있는 걸 먹으면 그냥 그게 행복해서 그런 부분에서는 국내 여행이 더 메리트가 있는 거 같아. 음 그래서 이번 여름에 어 비록 어 시골 마을을 여행했지만 그 안에서도 나는 행복을 느낄 수 있었던 거 같아. 어 비용적인 부분이나 다른 메리트가 없으면 당연히 색다른 것을 보고 나의 시야를 넓히는 게 더 좋다라고 생각을 해. 나도 아직 해외여행을 많이 가본 적이 없지만 여러 군데를 가보면 어 티브이로 보았던 거보다 더 많은 감정을 느끼지 않을까 싶어. 해외여행 갔을 때 그 나라의 요리 스타일이나 어떤 식당을 보게 되면 아 이 사람들은 이런 음식을 왜 먹는지를 생각하게 되거든. 예를 들면 더운 나라에서는 되게 향신료가 센 경우가 많아. 그런 것들을 보고 음식이 왜 이 나라에서 이런 식으로 발전했는지를 보면서 너무나 흥미로웠던 거 같아. 솔직히 말하면 어떤 예쁜 어 돌멩이를 보거나 바위를 보거나 폭포를 보거나 이런 것들은 나에게 있어서 그다지 흥미롭지 않았던 거 같아. 어 예를 들면 내가 가본 나라 중에 대만에서는 마늘을 생마늘을 테이블 식탁 위에 올려놓고 장사를 하더라고. 대만의 날씨 특성상 굉장히 습하고 더운 경우가 많은데 그럴 때 이제 음식을 썩지 않게 하기 위해서 그런 매운 식재료들을 많이 사용을 하는 걸로 알고 있어. 예를 들면 어 인도에서는 어 그런 후추나 매운 향신료를 쓰면서 보관 기간을 늘린다고 하더라고. 어 이거에 관해서 내가 찾아본 적이 있는데 화학적으로 이러한 식재료가 들어가게 되면 유통 기간이 더 늘어난 나는 것이 확인이 되어서 이 사람들이 단순히 입맛이 이래서 이랬다기보다는 어쩔 수 없이 이렇게 됐다라고 보는 게 좀 더 정확할 거 같아. 음 올 올해도 일정상 바쁜 일이 없었다라고 하면 해외여행을 가고 싶었는데 내년에는 조금 일찍 계획을 해서 해외여행을 가면 좋을 거 같다라는 생각이 들어. 나는 대부분 국가들을 방문해 본 경험이 없어서 아무 국가라도 상관이 없을 거 같아. 음 나도 여름휴가에 해외로 가는 게 쪼금 더 안목도 트이고 색다른 음식도 경험할 수 있고 많은 것들을 볼 수 있고 그 나라의 문화를 느낄 수 있다는 부분에서 굉장히 좋은 거 같아. 그리고 가격적인 부분에서 차이가 없다라고 하면 안 갈 이유가 없을 거 같아. 혹시 몽골이라고 선정한 이유가 있을까? 나는 성격 자체가 워낙 활동적인 성격이어서 바다에서 고래를 만날 수 있는 어 필리핀 세부를 생각을 했었어. 실제로 대학교 졸업 전에 친구들과 가기로 했었는데 어 중요한 발표가 정해지면서 못 가게 되었던 경험이 쪼금 아쉬움으로 남는 거 같아. 어 그렇지만 어 한국에 사막은 없기 때문에 그런 몽골에서의 경험도 너무 소중할 것 같아. 하지만 나는 어 쪼금 더 액티브한 것들을 즐길 수 있는 어떠한 바다가 있고 스노클링을 할 수 있고 그 바다 안에서 헤엄쳐 다니는 게 너무 흥미로울 거 같아. 그거에 관해서는 구체적으로 찾아본 것은 세부밖에 없지만 바다가 맑은 나라들은 많으니까 여러 나라들을 또 찾아보면 많이 나오지 않을까 생각하고 있어. 음 일본도 그런 것들이 충족이 된다라고 하면 너무나 재밌을 거 같아. 어 그러면 혹시 여름휴가에 대한 이야기만 했는데 겨울에는 휴가를 간 적이 내 기억 속에는 없는데 혹시 겨울 휴가에는 해외여행 장소가 어디가 괜찮을지 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 음 아무래도 여름휴가를 대부분 이제 회사들이 제공을 하기 때문에 여름 쪽에 더 많이 일반적으로 사람들이 생각을 가지고 있는 거 같아. 나도 겨울 여행지 하면 딱히 생각나는 게 스키장밖에 없었던 거 같은데 그에 비해서 여름에는 더 할 수 있는 것들이 많은 거 같다고 생각을 해. 아무래도 연말에 어 다른 이제 새해 1월 1일도 있고 크리스마스도 있고 그런 이벤트들이 이미 있기 때문에 휴가를 따로 내기 위해서 시간을 빼는 건 이미 많은 시간들을 썼기 때문에 겨울 휴가를 가는 건 쪼금 어렵지 않을까라고 생각은 하고 있어. 음 스키를 잘 못 타지만 좋아했던 거 같아. 몸을 쓰는 일이기 때문에 스키를 스키장을 가서 어 강사에게 배우고 친구들과 있으니까 자신감도 생기더라고. 그래서 겨울에 한번씩 스키장을 가서 이제 잊었던 몸의 감각도 다시 익히고 재밌게 탈 수 있었던 거 같아. 근데 사실 친구들과 가면 어 겨울 휴가 스키장의 목적은 스키가 아니라 술이었던 거 같아. 맞아. 그런 썰매를 타는 것도 되게 재밌을 거 같아. 생각보다 어 이런 눈 덮인 시설이 위쪽 지방에만 있을 줄 알았는데 우리 부산 인근에도 생각보다 많은 그런 겨울 레저 스 겨울 스포츠를 즐길 수 있는 곳들이 많더라고. 스키장도 에덴 밸리 스키장도 있고 어 눈썰매장은 어 굳이 찾지 않더라도 검색만 하면 바로 나올 정도로 많은 곳들이 운영을 하고 있는 것으로 알고 있어. 그래서 어 시간이 너무 없다라고 하면 휴가를 따로 쓰기보다는 주말에 당장 다녀올 수도 있을 거 같아. 맞아. 몸은 따뜻하면서 공기가 차가운 그런 기분이 굉장히 좋게 느껴지는 것 같아. 그런 부분에서 어 우리가 한여름에 에어컨을 틀고 이불을 덮는 것처럼 겨울에 어 특히 온천을 가는 게 색다른 기분을 느끼게 하는 거 같아. 그런 온천은 어 내가 잘 찾아보진 않았지만 온양 온천이 한국에서는 꽤 유명한 걸로 알고 있어. 그래서 겨울에 어 스키장이 아니더라도 그런 온천에 대해서 다시 한번 얘기를 해보는 것도 좋을 거
